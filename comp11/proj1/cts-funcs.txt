main
	purpose: declare the array and call the utility functions
	argumnets: 2D array of struct, number of elements
	returns: 0
	effects: sets up the array
	notes: calls the array using global constants

initialize
	purpose: fill the array with empty seats
	arguments: 2D array of struct, number of elements
	returns: void
	effects: changes the contents of the array to have empty seats and no	                 price

command
	purpose: read in a command from the user and call the correct function                   and loop until the user quits

	returns: void
	effects: does not modify the array
	notes: input must be a valid command

print
	purpose: prints out the array
	arguments: 2D array of struct, number of elements
	returns: void
	effects: does not modify the array
	notes: array should be filled with things other than dead squirrels

request
	purpose:reads in a request and checks if it is a valid request and if so        calls the appropiate function based on price type
	arguments: 2D array of struct, name, number of seats, price type
	returns: void
	effects: does not modify the array
	notes: uses parameters of the array to check validity

high
	purpose: fills seats for people who requested type high, checks all rows        to try and find enough seats in a single row for the party before               putting them anywhere it can, prints back info on party
	argumnets: 2D array of structs, number of seats requested, name
	returns: void
	effects: fills seats with name

low
	purpose: fills seats for people who requested type low, checks all rows         to try and find enough seats in a single row for the party before               putting them anywhere it can, prints back info on party
	argumnets: 2D array of structs, number of seats requested, name
	returns: void
	effects: fills seats with name

any
	purpose: fills seats for people who requested type any, checks all rows         to try and find enough seats in a single row for the party before               putting them anywhere it can, checks expensive seats first, prints back         info on party
	argumnets: 2D array of structs, number of seats requested, name
	returns: void
	effects: fills seats with name

cancel
	purpose: cancels a reservation by replacing seats with their name with          empty seats, tells you when its done, calls a function to double check          people who selected any to see if more money can be made
	arguments: name, 2D array of structs
	returns: void
	effects: empties seats with name
	notes: name must be reserved in order to cancel it

check
	purpose: finds the names of people who slected the any price type and           then re-calls the 'any' function to check if more money can be made
