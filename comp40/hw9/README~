HW9 README due 12/8/14
by James McCants and Jun Soo Shin

----- Help -----
We have received help from Jacob Katsiaficas, Aaron Bowen, and several TA's.

----- Implementation -----
We believe everything has been implemented correctly, but there may be some
edge cases we missed.

We have not implemented printing the most negative number, 0x80000000.

----- Departures from Convention -----
We used a urt0 file for initialization but otherwise our files are the same
using a callmain to initialize our program before running it.  

----- Implementation of Print -----
The print module divides the number by 10 and then multiplies it by 10 and then
subtracts the new number from the old number and pushes the difference onto a
stack and then divides it by 10 again; it does this until dividing by 10 leaves
0 and then it prints out the stack which the results were pushed onto. 

----- Hours Spent -----
Analyzing: 2 hrs
Writing Assembly Code: 10
Debugging: 5
