Profiling - Hw7

James McCants and Harrison Tross - 11/19/14


1. Help Received

- We received help from several TAs and got a general idea of where would should
be aiming at based on our classmates.

2. Slowest Routine

In the final UM the routine that takes the most time is Mem Load. This function
is normally inlined but we un-inlined all of the operation functions to see
which was taking the most time and then re inlined them in the final submission.

3. Time Spent

- We spent 2 hours analyzing.

- We spent 7 hours implementing.
