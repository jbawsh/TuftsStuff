Profiling - Hw7

James McCants and Harrison Tross - 11/19/14


1. Help Received

- We received help from several TAs and got a general idea of where would should
be aiming at based on our classmates.

2. Slowest Routine

In the final UM the routine that takes the most time is get_u. This function
is normally inlined but we un-inlined all of the operation functions to see
which was taking the most time and then re inlined them in the final submission.

Looking at the assembly we can't see any way of speeding that part up as it is
just shifting bits around. The reason we spend so much time there is that it
gets called ALOT. We could try and cut down on calls by making a mask that gets
all of the pertinent information out of the word in one call as opposed to the
3 or four currently required.

3. Time Spent

- We spent 2 hours analyzing.

- We spent 7 hours implementing.
