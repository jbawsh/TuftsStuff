Debug Report Lab 7

James McCants

1. The first bug was in dDA-1 schedule event. The program wasn't scheduling the
 event if it was after all of the other events.

2. Bug was in dDA-1 resizeList. They were missing the brackets before eventList
when deleting it.

3. The return statement happened right after the first event was moved so it had
to be moved outside of the for loop.

4. When canceling an event the student didn't decriment eventCount.

5. In dDA-2 they didn't resize the list if eventCount caught up with event
Capacity.

6. There is something duplicating events but I don't know what.

7. In cancel they didn't move all of the events over after the one cancelled.

8. Didn't account for events with the same start time that wouldn't be caught
by the amIBefore function.
