       The purpose of the program is to create a planner that stores events that
have a start time and a finish time within a day (0 - 2359). The planner stores
the events in order using and can delete events. The program can use either a
linked list or a dynamic array to accomplish this task.

 - main.cpp
        
        Stores events in the day and deltes them, runs the program

 - event.h        
 - event.cpp

        Contains helper functions for events: a print function and comparison
functions to check the order and similarity of events.

 - dayLinkedList.h
 - dayLinkedList.cpp

        Contains functions to add events to the list and delete events, also to
put the events in order.
