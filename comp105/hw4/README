-Disscussed some with Aaron Bowen

-Everything is solved except for 23 and I'm not sure if 16 part b is correct.

-Form - Exemplary, I think all the code is formatted well.

-Documentation - Satisfactory, I think my comments cover the contracts and 
                 important info of the code.

-Naming - Exemplary, I think all the names are good and clear about purpose.

-Cost - Satisfactory, I don't think anything is too much slower than it needs
        to be.

-Correctness - Satisfactory/Needs Improvement, I think things are working
               correctly but some things aren't finished so those definitely
               don't work.

-I spent 12 hours on this assignment but should've started earlier and probably
 would have spent more.
