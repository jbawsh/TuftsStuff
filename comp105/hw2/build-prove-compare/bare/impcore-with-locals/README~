We solved the problem of adding local variables by creating a new value 
environment for locals. We passed this environment through eval.c. Our most
significant changes were in the VAR and SET sections of eval where the 
semantics - requiring local variables with the same name as global or formal
variables to be used first - are defined. We initialized the values of the 
locals environment to 0 in the USERDEF section of the eval function with a 
recursive helper function called locallist.
