-It took me 10 hours to complete the assignment. 3 hours on part A, 3 hours
learning madoko, 4 hours on part B.

-Semantics: I think the rule changes work correctly.

-Rules: I think my rules follow the correct formatting and make sense.

-Derivations: I think the derivations follow the correct structure and don't
              skip any steps.

-Metatheory: I think I understood the question and I tried to explain what was
             happening. I was a bit confused after recitation and I'm not sure
             if what I have is setup correctly.

-The way my madoko was rendering in html is much prettier than the pdf. I'm
sorry if any of the formatting makes it difficult to read.
