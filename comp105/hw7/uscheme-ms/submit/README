Garbage Collector

James McCants and Aaron Bowen

-I worked with Aaron Bowen

-It took us 8 hours

-No further comments

-Here is a test case because it wouldn't take it in submit:

(cons 1 '(2 3 4 5 6))
(set it 1)
(cons 1 '(2 3 4 5 6))
(cons 1 '(2 3 4 5 6))

this test demonstrated the addition of new pages when more memory
was required. It also showed a disparity between live marks and 
total available space, indicating that the garbage collector was in
fact recycling space.
